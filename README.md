# RGB Tool

An ES6 Javascript class designed to provide a color selector in the shape of a regular polygon. It automatically appends its self-contained interface to the HTML element it receives as its first parameter during instantiation.

# Undergoing Refactor

This project is currently being refactored into a more performant version.

This codebase will be modernized to provide a React component.

# User Stories

- As a User, I can mouse hover to see a preview of a color.
- As a User, I can click to select a color.
- As a User, I can adjust the tint or shade of the color selected before confirming.
- As a User, I can confirm my color selection by clicking a "âœ“".
- As a User, I can cancel my color selection by clicking an "X"

# Planning

- Accurately graph the value of a color at a given angle.
- Allow color offset to enable each hue of a color triplet to utilize the same graphing function.

## Preview

The final project will resemble the following:
